These updates usually involve significant changes to Google's ranking factors, such as content quality, user experience, website speed, and much more, which can affect your SEO. They impact how websites are ranked in search results. For example, let's say you have a blog website that contains well-informed information, solves users' queries, and gets high traffic. However, over time, that information on the page becomes outdated or the trend for that topic decreases, and something new comes along that is much better than your content. Then, Google's algorithm has to decide which website should be prioritized and which content is outdated. To deal with this problem, Google frequently releases its core updates to understand which content should be prioritized to provide the best user experience.</p>
